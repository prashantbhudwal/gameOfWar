## Why this project

This is a guided project part of the Scrimba Frontend Path. The main objective of this project is to help me get familiar with promises. However, I also intend to practice some additional development constructs. These are:

- I intend to practice writing good commits.
  - The commit format:
    If applied, this commit will [your subject line here]
    Source: [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#why-not-how)
- I intend to write functions according to single responsibility principle.
- I intend to make the code as readable as I can make it.
- I indent optimize modularity of the code.

## About the Project

It is a basic app that lets you play a card game called war with the computer.

**Here is a description of the game from Wikipedia:
**
"The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.

- The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack.
- In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack.
  - Aces are high, and suits are ignored.
- If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war".
- Both players place the next card from their pile face down and then another card face-up.
- The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck.
- If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's."
